# chateda-bench

## Project Overview
## Installation

This project integrates with [ChatEDA](https://github.com/wuhy68/ChatEDA) to automatically generate and execute EDA scripts. By calling the OpenAI API, it converts high-level design intent into OpenROAD TCL scripts, enabling a complete flow from Verilog to GDSII.

## Usage
```
pip install openai
```
Refer to the ChatEDA repositoryâ€™s README for any extra dependencies as needed.
